This project contains a Jupyter notebook for waste segregation analysis. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the code.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create Directory for Dataset**\
   Inside the folder where the Jupyter notebook is located, create a directory named `DataSet_waste_segregation`.

2. **Copy Dataset**\
   Copy your waste segregation dataset zip into the `DataSet_waste_segregation` directory.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**\
   After completing the above steps, open the Jupyter notebook and run the code. The notebook is configured to access the dataset from the `DataSet_waste_segregation` directory.

## Notes

- Ensure the dataset zip files are correctly placed in the `DataSet_waste_segregation` directory before running the notebook.
- If you encounter any issues, verify the file paths in the notebook match the dataset location.
